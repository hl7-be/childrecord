## Artifacts Summary

This page provides a list of the FHIR artifacts defined as part of this implementation guide.

### Structures: Logical Models 

These define data models that represent the domain covered by this implementation guide in more business-friendly terms than the underlying FHIR resources.

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Child Report Logical Model](StructureDefinition-BeModelChildReport.md) | A logical model representing child report data elements. |
| [Document model](StructureDefinition-BeModelDocument.md) | Base model for documents. |
| [Related Person](StructureDefinition-BeModelRelatedPerson.md) | Related Person model. |

### Terminology: Value Sets 

These define sets of codes used by systems conforming to this implementation guide.

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Eye Movement and Position](ValueSet-VSEyeMovementAndPosition.md) | This value set includes codes to represent eye movement and position observations. |
| [Eye Screening Results](ValueSet-eye-screening-results.md) | A value set that includes codes for eye screening results. |
| [Neonatal Hearing Screening Results](ValueSet-VSNeonatalHearingScreeningResults.md) | This value set includes codes for neonatal hearing screening results. |
| [Ophthalmologist Treatments](ValueSet-VSOphthalmologistTreatments.md) | This value set includes codes for ophthalmologist treatment status. |

### Terminology: Code Systems 

These define new code systems used by systems conforming to this implementation guide.

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Eye Movement and Position](CodeSystem-CSEyeMovementAndPosition.md) | A code system for various eye movement and position conditions. |
| [Eye Screening Results](CodeSystem-CSEyeScreeningResults.md) | Codes for recording the results of eye screening tests. These codes are used to indicate whether a screening test was passed, failed, not possible to perform, or not testable in children. |
| [Neonatal Hearing Screening Results](CodeSystem-CSNeonatalHearingScreeningResults.md) | Codes for the results of neonatal hearing screening tests. |
| [Ophthalmologist Treatment statuses](CodeSystem-CSOphthalmologistTreatments.md) | Ophthalmologist Treatment statuses |
