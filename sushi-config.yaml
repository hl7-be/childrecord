# The following two lines correspond to items that used to be in
# ig.ini but were moved to IG.definition.parameter. For
# consistency within this file, the names are represented using
# camelcase, but if authors use the formal parameter names, SUSHI
# will recognize them as well. In either case, they'll be copied
# to the IG JSON using the formal names.

# The pages property corresponds to IG.definition.page. SUSHI can
# auto-generate the page list, but if the author includes pages in
# this file, it is assumed that the author will fully manage the
# pages section and SUSHI will not generate any page entries.
# The page file name is used as the key. If title is not provided,
# then the title will be generated from the file name.  If a
# generation value is not provided, it will be inferred from the
# file name extension.  Any subproperties that are valid filenames
# with supported extensions (e.g., .md/.xml) will be treated as
# sub-pages.

# The ImplementationGuide resource defines several other properties
# not represented above. These properties can be used as-is and
# should follow the format defined in ImplementationGuide:
# * meta
# * implicitRules
# * language
# * text
# * contained
# * extension
# * modifierExtension
# * experimental
# * useContext
# * copyright
# * packageId

# The menu property will be used to generate the input/menu.xml file.
# The menu is represented as a simple structure where the YAML key
# is the menu item name and the value is the URL. The IG publisher
# currently only supports one level deep on sub-menus.
# To provide a custom menu.xml file, do not include this property and
# include a `menu.xml` file in input/includes.
menu:
  Home: index.html
#  Guidance: guidance.html
  Artifacts: artifacts.html
  # Downloads: downloads.html
  # Changes: changes.html
#  History: ../history.html

# The parameters property represents IG.definition.parameter. Rather
# than a list of code/value pairs (as in the ImplementationGuide
# resource), the code is the YAML key. If a parameter allows repeating
# values, the value in the YAML should be a sequence/array. For a
# partial list of allowed parameters see:
# https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Implementation+Guide+Parameters
parameters:
  pin-canonicals: pin-multiples

# The FSHOnly flag indicates if only FSH resources should be exported.
# If set to true, no IG related content will be generated.
# The default value for this property is false.
FSHOnly: false

# When set to true, the "short" and "definition" field on the root element of an Extension will
# be set to the "Title" and "Description" of that Extension. Default is true.
#applyExtensionMetadataToRoot: false
